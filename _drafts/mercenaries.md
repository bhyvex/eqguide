The general rule is to always take a tank mercenary for the first 50 - 70 levels.  But is this really true?  Some people say that caster damage mercs are better; some say for special situations, others for all cases.  I decided to test this out.

So my test case is to take two identical clerics, and time them to run through Gloomingdeep; I may later take them further.  I set them up with some cash for spells, and ... nothing else.

Escape, Basic Training, trip to PoK for merc.
Tank: 12 mins
Caster: 10 mins

Rats and bats, finish spider quests. 
Tank: 1 hr 5 mins.  Level 5.
Caster: 1 hr 1 min. Level 5.

Note: missing cleric level 1 spells, eg Strike, DA, Cure Poison, from the "show items I can use" list for clerics, although they are on the merchants.

My feeling at this stage is that the tank merc is unkillable, but has very low dps.  The caster merc (on burn) runs out of mana quickly, and I have to tank, and let it med often.

Scouting, Battle, Sabotage, Leadership, Goblins:
Tank: 2 hr 10 mins, level 8.25 (dinged on hand-ins).  I am still doing the tanking most of the time, unless I back off, which isn't a bad strategy with nukes (Furor, level 5).
Caster: 1 hr 55, level 8.36. 

Locks, Flutterwing

Tank: 8.73, played 2 hrs 37 mins.
Caster: 9.22 (but double exp), 2 hrs 9 mins.


Overlord, Pit Fiend.

Tanks: 9.72, played 3 hrs.
Caster: Failed first try at Overlord (down to 3%).
