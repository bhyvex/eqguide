This is a charm slot augment that gradually increases in power as you complete more quests in the series.  There are better charm augments available, but this one is decent, and can be gathered as you follow the Hero's Journey progression, and in fact forms part of that overall achievement.

First of all, I want to express my disgust that SOE chose to spell lodestone as *loadstone*; it is (apparently) a valid spelling according to the dictionaries, although it is one that is never used.
