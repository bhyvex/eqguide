Tailoring for Beginners
-----------------------

I have added this because I have been trying to work my way through the Goru'kar Mesa quests, which require several trade skills, mostly notably tailoring.  The master reference is, as usual,  <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?33385-Complete-Tradeskill-Guide-6-1-(Serverwide-Drop-Edition)-Rev-Apr-2009">EQTraders</a>.  This suggest the Abysmal Sea starter quests, but the Crescent Reach equivalent is very much faster.  Just go to the tailoring area near the upstairs bank, and you will soon have skill 54.

As the Mesa quests will require you to make combines with a high trivial of just under 200 (170 - and possibly higher, I thought Ciodaru's quest requires some combines?), and starting with subcombines of around 50 trivial, it's a good idea to raise your skill significantly first.

- Woven Mandrake (trivial 66)
	- Mandrake Roots (2) - Alchemist Anum

Save all you make, and you'll probably need more, so don't worry about buying stacks of ingredients in advance.

2 stacks of 20, 21pp.  10 successes to 66.  6 stacks of combines in total, 63pp, made 39.

- Picnic Baskets (trivial 76, makes 10)
	- Woven Mandrake (1)
	- Steel Boning (1)

21pp for 2 stacks of small bricks, made 35 bonings.  17 combines to hit 76, made 110 picnic baskets, sold for < 6pp; sold the excess bonings for 4pp and the excess Wovn Mandrake for 3pp.  Skill now 76, time for the tailor trophy.

###Smithing Diversion

Steel boning is a Smithing recipe, trivial 37, so the starter quest in Crescent Reach will be enough to make some.

- Steel Boning (trivial 37)
	- File (1) - returned
	- Small Brick of Ore (1) - Smith Yahya
	- Water Flask (1)

And the file is:

- File (trivial 21)
	- File Mold (1) - Smith Yahya
	- Metal Bits (1)
	- Water Flask (1)

Metal bits are:

- Metal Bits (trivial 18, makes 2)
	- Small Piece of Ore (2) - Smith Yahya
	- Water Flask (1)

If you're working on the smithing components, then it's time to make your sewing needle.  This requires a trip to Surefall Glade to purchase the Steel bricks required; if you have a Gold account, you can use the shared bank to transfer cash to a level 1 character (human Karana ranger or druid; make sure you turn off the tutorial button!).

- Small Piece of High Quality Ore (27 trivial)
	- Small Brick of High Quality Ore (1) - Smith Yahya
	- Smithing Chisel (1) - Smith Yahya, returned

- High Quality Metal Bits (20 trivial)
	- Small Piece of High Quality Ore (2)
	- Water Flask (1)

- Small Piece of High Quality Ore (27 trivial, makes 2)
	- Small Brick of High Quality Ore (1) - Smith Yahya
	- Smithing Chisel (1) -  returned, Smith Yahya
	
- Steel Bits (24 trivial)
	File (1) - returned
	Small Brick of Steel (1) - Qaelin Hailstorm, Surefall Glade (outside near the archery range)

- Sewing Needle (30 trivial)
	- High Quality Metal Bits (2)
	- Jar of Acid (1) - Poisoner Salihah/Potter Subira
	- Needle Mold (1) - Smith Yahya
	- Smithy Hammer (1) - Smith Yahya, returned
	- Steel Bits (2)
	- Water Flask (1)

###Tailoring Trophy

If you are going to make a relatively high level combine, and 170 counts in my opinion, then the tailor trophy is probably worthwhile.  You need to see Baublie Diggs in West Freeport newbie yard to get started, make the items, then return to there to hand in to the judge.  If your skill is still under 100 (but over 50), this is the test you will be given.

All ingredients listed below are given the quantity required per combine.  I give a shopping list for dropped ingredients only below, which assumes all successful combines.  This requires a low level of smithing skill, and some effort with fishing.

Because of the way that combines work, you stand a much better chance of success if your skill level is well above the trivial for a combine, and even so (without AAs) there is always a 5% chance of failure.  So I would strongly suggest using the Fetid Essence (fishing grubs plus a water flask) combine in Plane of Knowledge (Caden Zharik) or Crescent Reach (Innkeeper Seltu, Merchant Kaphiri, Merchant Wyn'las) to get your brewing skill to 122 before making your fish oil, although I'm going to skip the trophy for this.

- Shopping List for drops
	- Spidering Silk (12)
	- Ruined Bear Pelt
	- Low Quality Bear Skin
	- Ruined Cat Pelt
	- Ruined Wolf Pelt
	- Low Quality Cat Pelt (or wolf, or bear)
	- Medium Quality Cat Pelt
	- Low Quality Wolf Pelt

Assuming no failures.  You can get most of these in Crescent Reach, or by vendor diving there.  Also a trip to Blightfire will be required, then probably one of the Karanas.  There are two good sources for spider silk: East Karana, or Upper Guk.  These spiders seem to drop more silk than most others, although you can continue to kill spiders in Goru'kar Mesa for silk and experience.  You will need a lot of spider silk to allow for failures in the higher level combines for the silkfang pack.  The wolf skin will require a diversion, possibly to Everfrost, and shade silk comes from Shak Dratha in Shadeweaver's Thicket.

###Back to Tailoring

Then what?

If you have a lot of High Quality Bear Pelts, then consider making Hand Made Backpacks (trivial 88, High Quality Bear Pelt, Backpack pattern) as a usable intermediate skill up step.  Tailored Quiver has a trivial of 115 (High Quality Cat Pelt, Quiver Pattern).

Start making subcombines to move quest stages forward, and the quest requires that you make them in a certain order: threads, spool, wolf beads, snake beads, string of teeth: and finally the pack.  So it is best to make them in that order, in the unlikely event that you succeed on the first try, as you would be required to repeat some of the combines just to complete the quest if you hadn't make the components in the right order.

- Spider Silk Thread (Tailoring, 50 trivial)
	- Spider Silk (8)

- Spool of Spider Silk Thread (Tailoring, 50 trivial)
	- Recluse Spider Fang (1)
	- Spider Silk Thread (3)

- Wolf Canine Bead (Tailoring, 50 trivial)
	- Sewing Needle (1) - returned
	- Wolf Canine (1)

- Snake Fang Bead (Tailoring, 50 trivial)
	- Large Snake Fang (1)
	- Sewing Needle (1) - returned

- String of Teeth (Tailoring, 92 trivial)
	- Snake Fang Bead (5)
	- Spider Silk Thread (1)
	- Wolf Canine Bead (4)

The final recipe is:

- Folded Silkfang Pack (Tailoring, 170 trivial)
	- Backpack Pattern (1)
	- Spool of Spider Silk Thread (1)
	- String of Teeth (1)
	- Supple Wolf Pelt (1)

Note that you could treat this as a free skill up route, as all the items are dropped, with just the sewing needle as a reusable tool.
