**Plane of Knowledge Quests**

The Plane of Knowledge has had some new quests added with the launch of Free To Play.

Secalna Galnor - near CR stone and loyalty vendor.  15 quests:

- Parcel Merchants
- Using the Marketplace
- Tribute
- Fellowships
- Extended Target Window
- Power Sources
- Loyalty
- Mercenaries for Hire
- Alternate Advancement
- Guilds & the Guild Lobby
- The Bazaar: Tricks of the Trade
- Auras
- Housing
- Claims
- Disciplines

Each involves finding and hailing an NPC in PoK; often Secalna herself, or NPCs near her.  Use ctrl-f to Find, and sort the find window by name (second column).  Rewards include: "Using the Marketplace" Complimentary Bottle of Adventure; "The Bazaar: Tricks of the Trade" a Trader's Satchel (heavy!) and a Sturdy Traveller's Pack (10 giant slots, 50% weight reduction, weight 2.2 - put the Trader's Satchel into this one for the time being).  

"Guilds & The Guild Lobby" leads to "Exploring the Guild Hall", and joins you to a guild - eg "Novices of Trakanon", which rewards you with an augment "A Glowing Emerald".  Then "Housing" rewards you with a "Behroe Style Stone Hut, Stucco interior" (housing item).

If you complete all of these quests, you complete the achievement "Tutorials - Out of Gloomingdeep".

PoK also has some older quests...

See [Vivian the True](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18497) if you are low level (below 10) for some small experience, or [Castlen Drewe](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18504), [Barrenzin](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18623) or [V'Lynn Renloe](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18679).  These NPCs give some quests from 10 to 20; rewards are Luclin era armor and weapons.  Many characters are unable to obtain these quests.
