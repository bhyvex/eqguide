This [quest](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=8025) gives one of the better rewards: a fast cast, 30 minute refresh, port to Plane of Knowledge.  I have
completed it with a level 53, so the posted minimum of 75 is not correct for the stein part.

This explains how to get the stein, without any extra running around.  First, go to Brasse in Plane of Knowledge, next to the brewing vendor by the small bank.  If your
Alcohol tolerance isn't already at least 50, buy around 60 Ogre Swills from Berina; and if it is, buy at least 21 (I'd guess 23 exactly) for Brasse.  Click a couple anyway, 
as you have to be drunk to get the quest.  Hail Brasse, and follow instructions - she likes Ogre Swills, so give her one, then give her a full stack, although this part 
may not be needed - you'll know after the hail. You should get the Pub Crawl shared quest, along with anyone else in your group.

Next, go to Abysmal Sea (use the Magus in the Guild Lobby).  Galdorin Visigoth is directly ahead of you (west), down one level in the brew pub area.  Buy a few Brasse's
Bitter Brew from one of the gnome vendors next to him.  Then make two socials like this:

Galdorin 1:

/pause 44, /say my stinky stein has rough dirty lips, 
/pause 44, /say but she loves a deep carouse. 
/pause 44, /say beer or ale are her great trips. 
/pause 44, /say no matter how many vows 
/pause 44, /say I make or break, my drinking glass

Galdorin 2:

/say reminds me of my lovely Brasse.

When you get there, Galdorin is unlikely to be singing this song.  So target him, click a bitter brew, put the bottle in your inventory, and right click it.  You
should see a yellow emote.  Click a few more (you will be max drunk after just one, but you can keep clicking).  Eventually, he starts singing: watch carefully,
and hit your Galdorin 1 button as soon as he starts; you will get a white emote to confirm that you are being heard after each line; you will need to click 
Galdorin 2 as soon as you hear the last line.  This part is very time sensitive, so don't be surprised if you miss it the first time.  If all goes well, you will 
have the stein on your cursor.  Click it to get back to Plane of Knowledge, and go somewhere to dry out.
