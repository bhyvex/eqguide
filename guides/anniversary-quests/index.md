Started at the fifth anniversary, these are all activated every year (so far). Before then there were various special events that
haven't been repeated. The ones worth doing are: Sixth (experience potion), Ninth (Plane of Knowledge gate) - for tanks/melees/hybrids, Tenth (title, experience potions, mount), and possibly the 11th/12th, for factions and augmentations, depending on the quality of gear.  The 12th solo augmentation is ok.

##[Fifth Anniversary Scavenger Hunt](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2850) (Classic) 

The reward is a [Staff of Endless Adventure](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/search.html?q=staff+of+endless+adventure), which is a firework clickie.

There is a quest NPC in each of the old starting towns (not sure about Crescent Reach), plus one in the Plane of Knowledge: Skrasa Ka'rok, a sarnak in an anniversary booth on the evil side.  When you accept the quest, you are given a Collection Bag and a Collector's Cheat Sheet; you have to collect ten items, each called a "Collector's XXX".  Answers given in the order I collected them:

- A Collector's Lightstone, dropped by willowisps in Commonlands. 
- A Collector's Mistmoore Granite, dropped by gargoyles in Castle Mistmoore. 
- A Collector's Water Ring, dropped by aqua goblins in Dagnor's Cauldron. 
- A Collector's Shark Tooth, dropped by old sharks in the Ocean of Tears.
- A Collector's Skunk Scent Gland, dropped by skunks in Toxxulia Forest. 
- A Collector's Kerran Doll, dropped by kerrans on Kerra Ridge in Toxxulia Forest (Paineel is the closest book from PoK). 
- A Collector's Fire Goblin Skin, dropped by goblins in Solusek's Eye (Sol A). 
- A Collector's Undead Froglok Tongue, dropped by undead frogloks in Lower Guk. 
- A Collector's Scythe, dropped by spectres near the entrance to the Plane of Fear in the Feerott. 
- A Collector's Preserved Split Paw Eye, dropped by gnolls in South Karana. 

To travel, I used PoK stones and origin, with the exceptions of Sol A and South Karana, where I used Guild Hall ports.  For difficulty (for low level players), spectres were the highest, then the old sharks, followed by the gnolls -  then everything else.

There are two gargoyles in Mistmoore right at the entrance; otherwise, you'll want to use the map to find the secret entrance in the graveyard, and travel to the gargoyle room from there.

In the Ocean of Tears, old sharks can be found around the ancient cyclops island (second west from Sister Isle).

Once you have them all, combine the bag and hand in.

##[Sixth Anniversary Scavenger Hunt](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3068) (Kunark)

Reward is a [Ceremonial Elixir of Scholarship](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=35074), a one time only experience potion with ten charges (meaning, you can't repeat the quest to get more).  You can't repeat this quest, it's just once per character.  There are two starter NPCs for this quest; one outside the elven outpost in Firiona Vie, and the other by the port in location in the Dreadlands.  Because of it's location, the Dreadlands quest giver, Sarvil Amberstone, is the easiest to start with, and you can move from there to Burning Woods, Frontier Mountains and back to the Dreadlands, then on to Firiona Vie and the Lake of Ill Omen, if you want to do them all in one quick sequence.

This quest is very similar to the Fifth Anniversary, in that you are given a Collection Bag and a set of clues.  Most of the zones required are a single step away from the Cabilis stone, although the Firiona Vie stone gives better access to several others: the Dreadlands mob area, through to Burning Woods, Frontier Mountains and to the Firiona Vie zone itself; and the Overthere stone to the Overthere.  The Dreadlands quest giver is best reached from the Guild Hall port.

There's a trick to this quest: the items mainly drop from wanderers, not from static camps; see my notes below.

- A Collector's Fire Hornet Wing, hornets in Burning Woods
- A Collector's Tump Stump, mountain giants in Frontier Mountains
- A Collector's Drachnid Web Sack, drachnids in the Dreadlands
- A Collector's Canine, drolvargs in Firiona Vie
- A Collector's Bloodgill Scale, bloodgills in Lake of Ill Omen
- A Collector's Sarnak War Braid, sarnaks in The Overthere
- A Collector's Nohope Moss, frogloks in Swamp of No Hope
- A Collector's Brittle Iksar Skull, (greater) skeletons in Field of Bone
- A Collector's Excavator Claws, Burynai Excavator in Kurn's Tower
- A Collector's Iksar Witch Doll, caster goblins in Warsliks Woods

I spent over two levels at 49 in Burning Woods, around the crater; then I got one from a roamer in the SW.  The Warsliks Woods drop came from a spirit caller somewhere in the woods, after clearing the fort around a dozen times.  The Firiona Vie drop came at the drolvarg building, SW of the elven camp in the far east.  The tump stump came from a wandering giant, after clearing the fort several times.

Bloodgills, drachnids and hornets are probably the highest levels, around 35-40 (wasps more like 40-46).

##Easter Quest

This was live for Easter in April 2011, so I'm going to call it an Anniversary quest; I will separate it out if it seems appropriate, like if any more quests are added.

- [The Origin of the Cuniculus](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=5311)

The quest is given by Grundle Cogwelder, near the soulbinder in the Plane of Knowledge.  Collect eight ground spawn eggs from fixed points in the Plane of Knowledge, Qeynos Hills, West Karana and South Karana.  Each zone has four of the egg types that you need.

The reward is:

- [Madness of Stomple](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=97153)
