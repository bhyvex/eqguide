Started at the fifth anniversary, these are all activated every year (so far). Before then there were various special events that
haven't been repeated. The ones worth doing are: Sixth (experience potion), Ninth (Plane of Knowledge gate) - for tanks/melees/hybrids, Tenth (title, experience potions, mount), and possibly the 11th/12th, for factions and augmentations, depending on the quality of gear.  The 12th solo augmentation is ok.

##[Fifth Anniversary Scavenger Hunt](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2850) (Classic) 

The reward is a Staff of Endless Adventure, which is a firework clickie.

There is a quest NPC in each of the old starting towns (not sure about Crescent Reach), plus one in the Plane of Knowledge: Skrasa Ka'rok, a sarnak in an anniversary booth on the evil side.  When you accept the quest, you are given a Collection Bag and a Collector's Cheat Sheet; you have to collect ten items, each called a "Collector's XXX".  Answers given in the order I collected them:

- A Collector's Lightstone, dropped by willowisps in Commonlands. 
- A Collector's Mistmoore Granite, dropped by gargoyles in Castle Mistmoore. 
- A Collector's Water Ring, dropped by aqua goblins in Dagnor's Cauldron. 
- A Collector's Shark Tooth, dropped by old sharks in the Ocean of Tears.
- A Collector's Skunk Scent Gland, dropped by skunks in Toxxulia Forest. 
- A Collector's Kerran Doll, dropped by kerrans on Kerra Ridge in Toxxulia Forest (Paineel is the closest book from PoK). 
- A Collector's Fire Goblin Skin, dropped by goblins in Solusek's Eye (Sol A). 
- A Collector's Undead Froglok Tongue, dropped by undead frogloks in Lower Guk. 
- A Collector's Scythe, dropped by spectres near the entrance to the Plane of Fear in the Feerott. 
- A Collector's Preserved Split Paw Eye, dropped by gnolls in South Karana. 

To travel, I used PoK stones and origin, with the exceptions of Sol A and South Karana, where I used Guild Hall ports.  For difficulty (for low level players), spectres were the highest, then the old sharks, followed by the gnolls -  then everything else.

There are two gargoyles in Mistmoore right at the entrance; otherwise, you'll want to use the map to find the secret entrance in the graveyard, and travel to the gargoyle room from there.

In the Ocean of Tears, old sharks can be found around the ancient cyclops island (second west from Sister Isle).

Once you have them all, combine the bag and hand in.
