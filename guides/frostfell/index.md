#Santug's Stocking (Frostfell 2006)

It's a good idea to collect your Adventurer's Stone for fast travel via the Maguses, if you don't already have one.  If your home city is Crescent Reach, you can start this quest by talking to Vladnelg Galvern sitting outside the upstairs bank.  This quest series should be doable by all over level 10.

##[Searching for Clues](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3920) - a Frostfell Goblin, home towns and Plane of Knowledge

Only available for the first couple of days.  After that, the remaining quest NPCs will appear in the home towns and Plane of Knowledge.  Collect five clues that drop from grimps (small red imps) in newbie areas.  Santug Claugg is a red armoured ogre who follows the same pathing as the grimps; he will cast disruptive spells on you (like Mesmerize).  When you hand in the clues to a Frostfell goblin, you will be given the next quest.

##[Saving Santug](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3921) - a Frostfell Goblin, home towns and Plane of Knowledge

You are sent to find the Grinnuch in Everfrost.  He's at the NW end of the triangle of land where the Wayfarer's camp is.  You are then told to search nearby, where you will find a hiding Frostfell goblin to talk to.  The final stage is to collect Santug's Gifts, which drop from (any) creatures in Everfrost, Permafrost and Blackburrow.  Keep bringing them to the goblin until he finds a sled, which you can give to the Grinnuch.  Almost every kill should drop a gift, and I needed 7 of them before I got the sled.

At the end of these two quests, you will have a (non-container) Santug's Stocking.

The above two quests are available for the first few days of Frostfell (started on 12 December, 2013. finishing on 17 December 2013).  After that, the remaining quests appear, and the NPCs sitting in every home town and Plane of Knowledge change.  You need to complete five quests in all to get the maxed out Santug's Stocking - which means all five of the following, or the previous two quests (counting as one) plus four more.

As some of these quests involve trade skills, you should aim to have baking over 135 and raise fishing as high as you can.  You will also want some smithed items: Animal Shaped Cookie Cutter (trivial 40), Muffin Tin (35), Bread Tin (40 - not needed as loaf of bread can be bought), and Pie Tin (35).  If you have completed the starter quests, you may want to consider skipping this one, which also needs  fair number of sub-combines.  You don't in theory need any fishing skill for the fishing quest, but you will need a lot of bait and a number of fishing rods.

##[Santug's List](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3927) - Santug Claugg, Plane of Knowledge 

The list portions drop from the Grimps, and you have to get the quest from Santug Claugg, after the first two quests are closed.  Do this in Butcherblock, and make sure you have the fishing quest (for the Dagnor's Cauldron fish) and Tinam's quest.  Concentrate on Tinam's quest, and kill any grimps you see - a see invisible buff will help a lot for this.  Most of the grimps will pass by the Knowledge Portal in that north/south passageway.

##[A Gift for Tinam](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3928) - Santug Claugg, Plane of Knowledge 

This is a FedEx quest; you collect it from Santug Claugg (home towns or Plane of Knowledge), go to Butcherblock, run around (a lot), then return to Santug.  If you are an evil race, make sure you have some way to invis, as you will have to pass by a number of guards who won't like you.

Locations:  

- Ebenizer - on the docks.  
- Horgram - south of the GFay zone line (SE corner of Butcherblock).  
- Hagbletha - southwest of the druid rings.  
- Firin McYorth - at the docks.  
- Morky - runs around the aqua goblin camps on the west shoreline.  

##[Fishing for a Feast](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3956) - Hargar the Velium Chef, Plane of Knowledge

You have to collect special fish from High Hold Pass, Lake Rathetear, Everfrost, Dagnor's Cauldron, and Feerrott. When you catch one of these fish, you should see a yellow text message. Most of these are straightforward, but in Everfrost you need to buy a Nest Lantern from the vendor (Maryg the Fisher) on the ice river; there are some reports that the other fish respond to a light source, although I can't say that I have noticed a difference.  The preferred fishing spot in Everfrost is at the end of the river in the underwater cave.  Note that the quest text says "Nest Trout", but actually you will catch "Everfrost Trout" for the hand-in.

In High Pass, try fishing outside the Tiger's Roar Inn.

In Lake Rathertear, fish from the Aviak Monument (on an island in the centre of the lake).

The rare fish aren't food, so you shouldn't need to worry about accidentally eating your catch.

You may be able to combine the fishing with trips to Everfrost/Butcherblock for the Santug's List quest.

The reward is a [Hargar Brand Fishing Pail](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=55236), which is a clicky bait dispenser.  If you have a [Fisherman's Companion](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16653) from the [Fisherman's Companion](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2236) quest, that dispenses free fishing rods (and helps a lot with Summon Ale, too!).

##[Baking for a Feast](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3959) - Hargar the Velium Chef, Plane of Knowledge

You are asked to supply the following:

- 4 Loaf of Bread (can be bought in PoK at Vuli Ironstove) 
- 4 Chocolate Muffins 
- 4 Pound Cake 
- 4 Meat-Filled Pie 
- 8 Animal Shaped Cookie

You can skip this step if you have done the first two quests; otherwise, the highest trivial is 135 baking, and you will need some smithed tools as well.

##[Fireworks](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3957) - Fireworks Engineer Fabdabus, Plane of Knowledge

This quest changes with level.  You can shroud down to accept a lower level quest, then unshroud to complete it.  The lowest level quest involves collecting fireworks that drop in Crushbone, Blackburrow and Upper Guk.  The mobs that drop the fireworks are casters and higher level mobs in general, so you can skip the low level melee-only mobs in each zone.

##[Upgrading Stockings](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3960) - a Frostfell Goblin, Plane of Knowledge

If, by any chance, your stocking isn't automatically upgraded, you can hand it in to one of the Frostfell goblins for an upgrade.

Final reward is [Santug's Stocking](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=55250)
