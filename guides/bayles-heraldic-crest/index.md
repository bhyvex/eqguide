{% include JB/setup %}

This includes the first progression series of quests for Seeds of Destruction; in fact, it is the progression series plus all the other quests required to complete the [Bayle's Heraldic Crest](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42727) shield augmentation for this line; the Allakhazam description has a good write-up in the comments.  By completing just the progression quests, you will gain access to the next highest level of Void, and will be able to hire Journeyman tier 2 mercenaries.

See [Samanna's (n√©e Rasper's) guide](http://rasper.samanna.net/SoD/BayleCrest.html) for details, although the ZAM guides for individual quests are more detailed.

All of these 22 quests take place in the Oceangreen theme zones.  If you just want the progression (and therefore Void and mercenary access), you only need six quests, but these include the group missions as well, which aren't required for the augment.

Some other quests that don't reward augment components are pre-requisites of these, so it gets complicated working out what exactly you need to complete.

One of the improvements in Seeds of Destruction with these long series quests was that you could store the quests pieces with Tavid Dennant in the Guild Lobby, and retrieve them when required to make the final combines.  The tasks also reward chronobines, and you should have no problem earning enough to buy components needed for combines.  Faction requirements may be a bit more tricky, however, and require repeating some quests.  Also, most quests here will give you 2 - 3 AAs or 1 - 2% level experience, which is a pleasant change.

As always, gather as many quests as possible for each area before you start, and try to be aware of what tasks require completion of other quests before they will open to you.

##Progression

For progression, you need the two quests from Sergeant Bronal Cadran, plus one that isn't part of the aug series, [Familiarity is Key](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4661) from Captain Hiran Tillin (mapping in Oceangreen Village), and three missions, two of which take place in Oceangreen Village instances, and one in Blackburrow.  As with the aug quests, you may need other precursor quests, and amiable faction to get the tasks.  The simplest way is to find someone who can request the missions for you.

To be fair, the only progression flags of much use in Seeds of Destruction now are from the Korascian Warrens to obtain J4 mercenaries.

##Oceangreen Hills

From Bayle's Keep in the north east:

- Garvin Windrunner: [Reduce the Risk](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4649), [Names for the Faceless](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4650)
- Tabron Caulria: [Does this Look Infected?](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4651), [Salving Grace](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4652), [Test the Waters](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4653)
- Archon Darianna Althus (amiable): [Thinning the Rank](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4666), [Plague from Above](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4660)
- Seradi Stormcall: [The Deathless](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4755) (in the Glade)

Infected animals, undead by the Keep, FedEx quest in Hills/Village.  You'll be killing the same mobs a lot for various drops in quests that can't all be done at the same time.  You want to open up Archon Darianna Althus's quests before you do the rest of the undead quests, if at all possible.

- Jeneca Orlofen: [Follow Your Nose](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4643)

Migglethorpe the Putremancer, level 76; wanders west of the keep mainly.

You need to have finished Tabron Caulria's (the keep) and Bronal Cadran's (the guard tower) quests to talk to Darianna Althus.

From the guard tower on the east side of the zone:

- Sergeant Bronal Cadran: [Man the Defenses](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4638)

Magus Wentior (SE corner, level 74).  He has a couple of guards, but they can be pulled singly.

From the Glade at the north of the zone:

-  Kerrin the Unkempt: [Cure the Crud](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4644), [Poach the Poachers](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4645), [Stop the Spreading](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4646)

Foraged and ground spawn, the poachers (need a tracker while doing something else), then kill in the Glade.  Don't forget Seradi Stormcaller's quest from the keep, as you will need to have done at least Kerrin's first two to request it.

One to be carried out in Oceangreen Village, and comes from the guard tower on the east side of the zone:

- Sergeant Bronal Cadran: [No Cure for Death](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4642)

Kill cultists around the Temple of Bertox in Oceangreen Village; pick this one up with the Village quests.

These are carried out in Blackburrow, and are taken from the Darkpaw camp on the west side of the zone:

- Fripp Darkpaw: [What Evil Lurks in the Heart of Gnolls?](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4648), [Send the Message](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4647)
- Elder Mystic Foppye: [Invading the Invaders](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4668)
- Bracka Darkpaw: [Summary Execution](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4669)

Starts with killing lurkers outside Blackburrow, then moves inside.  If you are trying to qualify to request the instance missions needed for progression, you probably have to complete all these first, and possibly repeat to gain faction.  You need to ...do something... to be able to enter Blackburrow.

##Oceangreen Village

- Dan Hearthpride: [Arms of the Dead](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4654)
- Viktor Snowborn: [Paint Supplies](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4656)
- Yvette Miller: [Good Seeds](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4655)

Kill undead and animals in Oceangreen Village.

This is carried out in the Temple of Bertoxxulous:

- Apothecary Cadmael: [A Secret Hidden In Plain Sight](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4670)

Kill in the temple, then clear an area and summon a named to kill; mobs are 75-78.  This is probably the hardest quest in the sequence; see the ZAM link for details.

##Old Blackburrow

- Guard Ellery: [Run to Daylight](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=4680)

Escort quest in Blackburrow, can be done at any time you are there, best combined with one of the kill quests.
