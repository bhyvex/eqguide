The Plane of Knowledge has had some new quests added with the launch of Free To Play.

Secalna Galnor - near CR stone and loyalty vendor.  15 quests:

- Parcel Merchants
- Using the Marketplace
- Tribute
- Fellowships
- Extended Target Window
- Power Sources
- Loyalty
- Mercenaries for Hire
- Alternate Advancement
- Guilds & the Guild Lobby
- The Bazaar: Tricks of the Trade
- Auras
- Housing
- Claims
- Disciplines

Each involves finding and hailing an NPC in PoK; often Secalna herself, or NPCs near her.  Use ctrl-f to Find, and sort the find window by name (second column).  Rewards include: "Using the Marketplace" Complimentary Bottle of Adventure; "The Bazaar: Tricks of the Trade" a Trader's Satchel (heavy!) and a Sturdy Traveller's Pack (10 giant slots, 50% weight reduction, weight 2.2 - put the Trader's Satchel into this one for the time being).  

"Guilds & The Guild Lobby" leads to "Exploring the Guild Hall", and joins you to a guild - eg "Novices of Trakanon", which rewards you with an augment "A Glowing Emerald".  Then "Housing" rewards you with a "Behroe Style Stone Hut, Stucco interior" (housing item).

If you complete all of these quests, you complete the achievement "Tutorials - Out of Gloomingdeep".

PoK also has some older quests...

See [Vivian the True](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18497) if you are low level (below 10) for some small experience, or [Castlen Drewe](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18504), [Barrenzin](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18623) or [V'Lynn Renloe](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=18679).  These NPCs give some quests from 10 to 20; rewards are Luclin era armor and weapons.  Many characters are unable to obtain these quests.

One interesting quest is the [Fisherman's Companion](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2236), from Ramos Jirwan at the fishing pool in the west.  This gives you a clickie [Fisherman's Companion](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16653) to summon +skill fishing rods, which summon beer.  You just need to catch fish in three different Planes of Power zones, then prepare them to extract bones (trivial 182 fishing).

##Sunrise Hills

Not the Plane of Knowledge, but close enough.  There are several quests here with various rewards.  One of the most appealing for low level characters is a quest, [Courier of Favor](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=5522), for a 20 slot bag, [Featherweight Satchel of the Courier](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=100133).  You must first complete two other quests, [Postmaster's Challenge](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=5521), which unlocks several other quests in the zone, and [The Nonad Brothers](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=5300).  This involves completing all of the old world bard "Going Postal" quests.  These start with Postmaster Sric Songfairer, Pagus Nonad, Lysric Loresinger - all in Sunrise Hills.

This may actually be the rare example of a modern quest that can only be completed by "good" faction characters.
