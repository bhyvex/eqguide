I have attempted to collect together all of the easy to obtain bags.  Most of these can be gathered at level 1, either as drops, easy purchases in accessible zones, or from simple quests.  Most of the rest can be quested around level 20, or with minor trade skills.  The final remainder are ones I just couldn't resist adding in - mainly famous classic bags.

My suggestion for a new character is to first see if you have the claims for the two Dreamweave Satchels, which are one per character; if you never bought House of Thule, you may not have them.  Next, open barrels in Gloomingdeep to get bags, ending up with backpacks - plain old, 8 slot, no weight reduction, backpacks.  If you visit the Plane of Knowledge, then you can buy deluxe toolboxes (use Find on the tinkering vendors), which are ten slot; also do the Bazaar quest from Secalna Galnor for the Sturdy Traveller's Pack.

If you are a 'good' race, then you can consider doing the Courier of Favor quest from Sunrise Hills; this takes some time (a few hours) to complete.

The next most accessible, reasonable bag is the Ore Hauler's Haversack, the result of a quest from Smith Bronson in Crescent Reach.

If you have some trade skills, then the trade skill trophies can all summon temporary bags.  If you [hand them in to Jolum](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2154) in the Bazaar, he gives you an Artisan Seal, with instructions to combine the seal in a trade skill container.  This isn't really worth doing until you have a skill level of 200-250, but if you have 300, you will be rewarded with two bags, one very large bag for trade skill components only, and a 12 slot, 100% WR bag.

Claims from purchase of Veil of Alaris.

##Marketplace

- [Weapon Crate of the Mercenary](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=95621)
- [Supply Chest of the Mercenary](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=95623)
- [Strongbox of the Mercenary](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=95622)
- [Trademaster's Component Satchel](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=104145)

Prices vary when SOE put on a special promotion.  For any spending in the marketplace, try to make use of promotions selling Station Cash - there reasonably often are double cash days, and infrequently there will be a triple cash day.  Also watch out for reseller specific (e.g. Walmart or Game) cards that give bonus cash.  It may be cheaper to buy cards and redeem them than it is to buy Station Cash directly from SOE, although this can depend on currency exchange rates.
