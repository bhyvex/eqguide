{% include JB/setup %}

This is just some suggestions as to how to best level on a Classic or Progression server that has only classic zones available: Antonica, Odus, Faydwer.
Levelling is going to be slower than in current Everquest, as recent progression servers (Fippy and Vulak) have been capped at 2% experience per kill.  It is also possible that Luclin
armour quests may be available for a starting Progression server, so bear that in mind.  Modern Everquest has made many changes from the original, meaning that, in
general, things will be a little easier to kill than they were at launch; bear that in mind. Also, monks are very likely to keep the modern Everquest fist
ratios (better than dragon weapons).  Rules relating to pet damage and eating experience will also be as per current, giving an advantage to magicians and necromancers, and probably also enchanters.

Ragefire doesn't have the same exp cap counting against soloing, which is an improvement for most.  The Lucin armor quests aren't in this time around.

For choosing classes, see [this cache of an old forum post](../mandaar).

If you like nostalgia here is [EQAtlas](http://www.allakabor.com/eqatlas/atlas.html); and it often has more detailed information than is on the in-game maps.

## 0 - 5

Spawn in your home town, and kill in your newbie area.  Do some research on quests that may speed levelling (bone chip hand-ins, Crushbone belts, gnoll fangs, orc scalps, etc).  Most of these quests are also excellent for gaining faction with these towns.

- [Crushbone Belts (Kaladim)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=294)
- [bone chips (Kaladim)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=366)
- [bone chips (Felwithe)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=91)
- [bone chips (Qeynos)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=574)
- [Gnoll Bounty (Halas)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=225) - gnoll fangs
- [Moonstones (S Qeynos)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=544)  - gnoll fangs
- [Orc Scalp Collecting (Highpass)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=262) - this one needs higher level just to get to the hand-in, but the scalps can be collected at low levels
- [Deathfist Slashed Belts (Freeport)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=114) - for good characters
- [Deathfist Slashed Belts (Commonlands)](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=115) - for evil characters
- [Fire Beetle Eyes (Neriak Third Gate)]() - Noxhil V'Sek, top floor of necromancer guild

## 6 - 15

Move to the nearest dungeon and kill, gradually moving around the zone to the highest level mobs.

Crushbone: for Kelethin, Ak'anon, Kaladim, Felwithe

Blackburrow/Qeynos Catacombs: for Qeynos, Surefall Glades, Halas

Befallen/Freeport Sewers: Freeport, Neriak

Upper Guk: Grobb, Oggok

Runnyeye: Rivervale

The Warrens: Erudin, Paineel - not present in Classic, was originally added with the Hole, but...

## 15 - 25

Najena, South Karana, Unrest

## 25 - 35

Mistmoore, Solosek's Eye (Sol A),Cazic-Thule (if lower level version of zone), Unrest, High Keep (basement), Permafrost

## 35 - 50

Nagafen's Lair (Sol B), Lower Guk, Kedge Keep, High Keep (nobles & guards)

## Variations

If you don't like one camp, there are plenty of others that I haven't listed.  Feel free to move between areas, although long runs and yoar travel will eat into your
levelling time.  Careful reading of the above will show that starting on Odus will force you to move around 25; Kerra Isle (part of Toxxulia Forest now) and
Erud's Crossing have some reasonable camps while you travel.  If I were to choose one area as a "best" newbie area, it would be Qeynos newbie yard. However...

The options for the final levels are strictly limited: most people won't like fighting in Kedge Keep (and I can't blame them), and High Keep is really a solo camp,
which brings it down to Lower Guk and Sol B, both on the same side of Antonica, making Neriak an ideal base for both of these zones.
Good characters will need to allow a little more time for corpse runs.
