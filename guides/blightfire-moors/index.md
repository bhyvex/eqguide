***Work in Progress!***

You have to be in Blightfire Moors to see the details in your Tome of the Hero's Journey.

Make sure you have the explore task from Regan, and check Smithy Bronson for three quests before you leave Crescent Reach.  Check the Moors sign post as you zone in (yes, you have to click on it).

**Rats & Snakes**

The Moors are divided into several areas that interest us. As you enter, right by the signpost, are rats and snakes.  Watch out for the named rat and snake, Plaguebringer and Mossback, who are level 25 but drop some valuable items.  Kill these to complete the first two quests, then head east and collect the quest from Ordunn the Miner.  Then go to Scout Zerak across the hill to the south, standing guard north of the gnoll mines.

**Gnolls**

To the south are the gnolls, and Scout Zerak can be found on the grass north of the mines and gnoll camps.  Follow the road east from the sign post (it splits into three, stay heading due east) and find the caravan outpost, where most of the quest NPCs can be found.  Along the road to the north you will have passed the druid rings, with one more quest NPC.  You can ignore further east for the moment.  Collect quests, and make sure you have all the explore quests and gnoll quests, then head to Scout Zerak for his quests.  These were given in Crescent Reach by Smithy Bronson, and at the outpost by Ordunn the Miner.  

Kill gnolls and periodically return to the NPCs for hand ins; make sure that you collect 8 in total rock breaker hammers, as both Scout Zerak and Smithy Bronson want four of them.  Note that miners are rare outside of the caves, but plentiful inside.  Once you have completed Ordunn's quest, return to him before heading back to Crescent Reach.  Anarynn, who is missing a locket, can be found in the inn (bottom floor, third door on the left).  At this point you will have received a cloak, a very nice 75% weight reducing backpack, and, once you have completed the Mucktail Mines by killing Pit Boss Scar, a weapon.  Pit Boss Scar in in the middle mine; and Ambassador Orren is in the easternmost one.  Scar has two linked guard dogs, and drops three parts of his shield, so this is good for three characters at once; he also takes several hours to respawn after he is killed (or he did, before the Hero's Journey).  This should complete Two Gnolls With One Stone, rewarding you with a neck item.  The hammer (1HB) reward for the Mucktail Mines is very nice, but is for melees and hybrids, excluding knights, only.  At this point I had hit 27, but again, Blightfire was a hot zone and this was in a bonus experience period (+30%).

**Mostly Walking Plants**

At around the same level you should first kill saplings and treants around the druid rings, then the sporali farmers further north.  You can't use /open on the Rotwood Spores; you have to hit them to collect the spore.  Then you can kill turtles and lockjaws; the ticking crocodile is spawned in the pool south of the outpost by killing lockjaws, but the skins only drop from the northern pools, with the turtles.  Quest givers for these are Ozzana the Trapper and Hammerstock.  Back to Crescent Reach and Smithy Bronson for the Golden Pick hand in.

I would then kill witchlamps west and south west of the outpost.  Next stage is to finish the Golden Pick in the mines.

Then finally work your way anti-clockwise around the crater working on the explore quests to reach the slashclaws (in the cliffs east of the gnolls), then north to the shrubs, then the ghostpack.  The green oozes are in the central crater.  NPCs for these quests are Alchemist Ella, Roanoak, Farmer D'Resh (in the inn in Crescent Reach, near the other farmers), Fletcher Orshawn, and Ozanna the Trapper.
