I've been making continuous updates as I go, adding new content and
correcting any problems with older content.

This post is to inform readers of a couple of bigger than average
updates: I have upgraded the software behind it to the latest
versions of Jekyll and Jekyll Bootstrap, which hader than it sounds.
I have also picked up a few changes in links that needed updating (to
Daybreak Games sites, mainly).

My targets are to keep gradually updating the tradeskill and quest
guides, and to merge in data from
[TNZFAQ](http://www.paullynch.org/tnzfaq/), with some new content
along similar lines.
