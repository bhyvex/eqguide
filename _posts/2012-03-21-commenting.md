I have enabled Disqus for comments.  As I don't know how well this will work, I will be keeping a close eye on it for a while as the site develops.  As ever, I reserve the right to disable comments at my whim.

Just for information: my personal EQ blog gets several thousand spam comment attempts per week.  All bar one or two of which are trapped by the Akismet plugin for WordPress.
