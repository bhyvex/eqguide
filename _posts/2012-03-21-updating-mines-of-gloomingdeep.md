I have gone through and updated the Mines of Gloomingdeep guide to make sure it exactly matches the experience of the new and revised tutorial.  If you've gone through the tutorial in the last few years, you'll already be familiar with it.  This process involved me running fully through all the quests twice, and partially a couple more times.

One nice new feature is that vendors can be set you show only items that you can use.  The (rather poor) intro movie was put back in, some of the bugs were fixed (like missing spells and combat abilities), a lot of new quests were added to cover recent features, and rewards have been updated to Defiant equivalent levels.
