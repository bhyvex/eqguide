I have added a number of new guides since the last post, as well as the ongoing checks and updates for existing guides.

- Easy Armor Progression: which goes through the level ranges to consider specific Bazaar upgrades
- Pet Focus Progression: for pet classes, the easy to obtain pet focuses, the level to equip and the pet levels they affect
- Bayle's Heraldic Crest: the quest series for the Oceangreen augment reward
- Kunark Express: a nostalgic summary of the Kunark levelling zones
- Luclin Express: the same for Luclin

Enjoy!
