I believe that I have Jekyll and JekyllBootstrap working together, and have patched JekyllBootstrap to work with Dreamhost, although admittedly in a rather crude way.  Deployment is manual at the moment, but should be automated in the next few days.

One glitch I noticed with deploying to Dreamhost, and I think this applies to all Dreamhost sites: it takes a couple of minutes from uploading replacement pages before they are accessible through the Dreamhost server.  This means that page loads and refreshes during that time can glitch - one page update is applied, but not a different page that was uploaded at the same time, or some pages may display without the proper css being applied.

I will announce the site later today.
