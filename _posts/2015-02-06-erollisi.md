I've been updating the annual quests over the past few weeks, making sure that I am completing each quest series as they launch.  Frostfell/New Year and Erollisi's Day are complete now (for 2014/2015).  As always, I am making minor changes either to keep up with patches, or to correct errors (mostly speeling) as I find them.
