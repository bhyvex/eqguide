I have updated the Jekyll gem used to drive this site, and in so doing have caught all (I hope) of the broken links that were hanging around from the old version.

As well as that, there are content updates to fix some minor issues (spelling), and a revision of the Jonas Dagmire's Skeletal hand guide, as well as a general review of all pages for appropriate updates.
